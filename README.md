University of Texas at Austin Coding Bootcamp: Homework 4 (Challenging)


To start the game, the user must select a character from the four available (green). This will be their character throughout the game. Next, the user must select someone to challenge (red). 

Each character has a set amount of health points. The goal of the game is to reduce the challenger's health points before they can reduce the user's. 

The "attack" button is used by the challenger to hurt the challenger, starting with an attack point value of 6 and increasing by 6 each subsequent attack. 

The challenger can counter attack, decreasing the user's health points by a set counter attack point value each turn. 

If the user defeats the challenger, they may select their next challenger from the remaining characters. 

The game ends when either the user defeats all challengers or a challenger defeats the user.
